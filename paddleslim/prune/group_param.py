    """Collect convolution layers of graph into groups. The layers in the same group is relative on pruning operation.
    A group is a list of tuple with format (param_name, axis) in which `param_name` is the name of parameter and `axis` is the axis to be pruned on.

    .. code-block:: text

       conv1->conv2->conv3->conv4

    As shown above, the demo has 4 convolution layers. And the shape of convolution's parameter is `[out_channel, in_channel, filter_size, filter_size]`. If parameter of `conv1` was pruned on axis 0, then the parameter of `conv2` should be pruned on axis 1. So the `conv1` and `conv2` is a group that can be represented as:

    .. code-block:: python

       [("conv1", 0), ("conv2", 1)]

    If `params` is `["conv1", "conv2"]`, then the returned groups is:

    .. code-block:: python

       [[("conv1", 0), ("conv2", 1)],
        [("conv2", 0), ("conv3", 1)]]

    Args:
       params(list): A list of convolution layer's parameter names. It will collect all the groups that contains anyone of these parameters.
       graph(paddle.static.Program | GraphWrapper): The graph used to search the groups.

    Returns:
       list<list<tuple>>: The groups.
